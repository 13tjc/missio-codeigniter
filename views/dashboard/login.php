        <h2>Welcome Project Leader!</h2>
        <p>Thanks for sharing your good work on Missio!</p>
        <p>This page provides tools to help you connect with those who will support your project on Missio.  Through this page, you can communicate with those who have connected to your project, either by a donation (GIVE), a share on social media (SHARE), or an action of some kind (ACT).  You can also respond to their other posts – perhaps offer a word of encouragement or advice to something they posted on Missio related to your project.</p>
        <p>Some tips during the time your project is seeking support:</p>
        <ul class="lm1em">
        <li>Thank individuals – in the same stream of messages connected to your project – for their support!</li>
        <li>Thank individuals – in the same stream of messages connected to your project – for their support!</li>
        <li>Share photographs from your project – or a video.  Share an event related to your project, or just a photo of something from everyday life where you are.</li>
        <li>Add to the details about your project. For example, if you seek money to build a classroom, talk to donors about the needs of one or two children and the impact a new classroom would have on these students.</li>
        <li>Ask supporters for something – to share your project, to say a prayer for something going on that day or week – and promise to pray in return.</li>
        </ul>
